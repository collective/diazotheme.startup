diazotheme.startup
==================


Introduction
============

``diazotheme.startup`` package provides diazo themes based on the *Initializr* 
using the **theming** and **packaging** features available for create Diazo_ theme
using `plone.app.theming`_.

`Initializr`_ is here to kick-start the development of your new projects. It generates templates 
based on HTML5 Boilerplate by allowing you to choose which parts you want or don't want 
from it. A `responsive template`_ has also been added to start from a basic design instead 
of a blank page.

This package contains *five diazo themes* that are good to use as startups for 
new themes. Four of the themes are to be used with `Sunburst Theme`_ as Theme base. 

The *three default themes* options you get with `Initializr`_:

- **Startup Bootstrap Jumbotron Initializr** Theme, it's a HTML5 boilerplate 
  bootstap option based on `Bootstrap Jumbotron example`_. It's got the hero unit on 
  home and is making use of a lot of  trickery that has been expanded in 
  `diazotheme.bootstrap`_ package.

- **Startup Classic HTML5 Boilerplate Initializr** Theme, it's a bare bones diazo theme that just 
  gives you normalization and default text styling based on `Classic H5BP template`_.

  The H5BP theme css and html has not been altered from the download, so with 
  new versions it should be a matter of dropping in new files.

- **Startup Responsive Initializr** Theme, it's a responsive option based on the
  *Jonathan Verrecchia* `responsive template`_ (except with plonified colors).

  There is the responsive theme, which only adds responsiveness to the 
  "`Sunburst Theme`_" theme base. It should be able to be used as an easy 
  responsification option to old style themes based on Sunburst. (Some style 
  altering will probably be necessary)

The *last two themes* are the *Plone Classic* and *Plone Sunburst* themes 
applied to the "(unstyled)" theme base. These would be practical to use as
a basis for fully functional themes (edit included), because they are near 
identical and they therefore all the default javascript works. 

- **Startup Plone Classic** Theme, a diazo theme for Plone `Classic Theme`_.

- **Startup Plone Sunburst** Theme, a diazo theme for Plone `Sunburst Theme`_.


How to create a child theme
---------------------------

Any of the three theme folders can be used to create your own theme. You can either 
wrap the theme up in a package or you can create a zip file of the folder and upload 
that to the theme panel.

There are two ways of creating a child theme.


The package way
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For this example, lets assume we are creating a diazo package theme called
``newtheme`` and we will copy the ``h5bp`` theme in this 
package.

1. Created the ``diazotheme.newtheme`` package (for instance through ``paster`` script).

2. Copy ``diazotheme.startup/diazotheme/startup/h5bp`` to
   ``diazotheme.newtheme/diazotheme/newtheme``.

4. Add `<plone:static directory="newtheme" name="startup_initializr_newtheme" type="theme"/>`
   to ``diazotheme.startup/diazotheme/startup/configure.zcml``.

5. Change ``diazotheme.startup/diazotheme/startup/newtheme/manifest.cfg``
   to reflect the changes, so: ::

        [theme]
        title = New theme
        description = Describe the new theme
        rules = /++theme++startup_initializr_newtheme/rules.xml
        prefix = /++theme++startup_initializr_newtheme
        doctype = <!DOCTYPE html>
        preview = preview.png


The zip file way
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Again, lets assume we use the ``theme`` theme and we want to end up
with the ``newtheme`` name.

1. Copy ``diazotheme.startup/diazotheme/startup/h5bp`` to your file system.

2. Rename ``h5bp`` to ``newtheme`` (the folder name will become the
   theme name in the theme panel)

3. Change ``newtheme/manifest.cfg``
   to reflect the changes, so: ::

        [theme]
        title = New theme
        description = Describe the new theme
        rules = /++theme++startup_initializr_newtheme/rules.xml
        prefix = /++theme++startup_initializr_newtheme
        doctype = <!DOCTYPE html>
        preview = preview.png

4. Customize your theme.

5. When you are finished customizing, create a zip archive of the 
   ``newtheme`` folder.

6. Upload the ``newtheme.zip`` in the plone theme panel.
